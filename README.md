# YouTube-Creative-Commons-Testbed-Videos
- The presented video sequences in this project are generated from the orginin video sequences that you can watch in [1] or [2].
The origin videos are 24, where each one had 30 seconds duration and Full HD resolution.

- A detailed decription of all the origin video sequences are given in Figure "Origin video sequences information".

- In this project, the modified video sequences (reduced quality) are shared. In fact, for each origin video sequence, five sub-qualitties (144p, 240p, 360p, 480p  and 720p (HD)) are created.   

- All the modified video sequences are available in the link [3].

- An objective evaluation of the modified video sequences is presented in the file "Objective-Study.xlsx". In this evaluation, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM) metrics were calculated.
